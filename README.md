# Xpx Wallet Concept Paper
The XPX Wallet is one of the official applications of ProximaX, offering total security for the storage, sending and receiving of your assets. With the XPX Wallet you can make use of mosaics, namespace, notarization of documents, voting, transaction explorer, contact directory as well as create and import your encrypted account.

It is available for Windows operating systems, Mac OS, Linux and a generic version.

# Account Service
This service consists of a pair of keys (public and private key) associated with a mutable state stored in the Sirius blockchain platform of ProximaX.

An account can represent a deposit of tokens, as in most known blockchains. However, it could also represent a single object that must be unique and updatable: a package to send, the writing of a house or a document to be notarized.

Remember to keep your private key in a safe place without an Internet connection. The private key can not be recovered.
